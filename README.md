# Wowser

This is a side-project writen to learn Rust and therefore likely contains numerous issues, lacks in performance, and may have security or availability risks.

As a general rule, it avoids using 3rd-party dependencies where possible to provide more opportunities to learn.

## Building

This project is built with Rust. To get started, install [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs) and build with `cargo`.
